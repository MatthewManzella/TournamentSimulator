If you don't have Python installed on your computer, do these 2 steps first:

1. Download and install Python:
   - Go to the official Python website: (https://www.python.org/).
   - Click on the "Downloads" tab.
   - Choose the version that is appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before proceeding. 

2. Verify Python installation:
   - Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the version number of Python, indicating that it was installed successfully.

To download the respository from GitHub:

1. Click on the Code button:
   - On the repository page, look for a green button that says "Code". It's usually near the upper right side of the page.

2. Download the repository as a ZIP file:
   - Click on the "Code" button, and then select "Download ZIP". This will download a compressed file that contains all the files and folders from the repository.

3. Extract the ZIP file:
   - Locate the downloaded ZIP file on your computer (usually in the "Downloads" folder). Double-click the file to extract its contents into a folder. 

4. Ensure that you are aware of and know how to access the file's absolute path:
   - This will be needed to run the program later on.

5. Open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux):
   - On Windows, you can do this by searching for "cmd" or "Command Prompt" in the start menu.
   - On macOS, you can find the Terminal in the Applications folder, under Utilities.
   - On Linux, you can open a terminal using a keyboard shortcut like Ctrl + Alt + T.

6. Navigate to the folder that you created in step 3:
   - Use the cd command (which stands for "change directory") followed by the path to the folder where the files downloaded from the repository are. 
   - For example, if your files are in a folder called "my_project" within a folder called "container" on your desktop, you would type: cd Desktop\container\my_project

7. Run BracketFiller.py by typing: python BracketFiller.py
